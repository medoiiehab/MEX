# MEX
this is a fake site I made after a database project that I made for college. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## so basically I made a site inspired by a database project I made for a class in my college.
## because I made graphic designs (which I didn't use yet, just the logo) for it, I wanted to make something that looks good and make it as if it were a real web-site.


## problems:
### 1-the colors are messed up. (in trial and gosh I got a bad taste in colors)
### 2-something feels missing but I dunno what. 

## goals: 
### 1- add a promo vid via youtube (50%).
### 2- make it more authentic and believable.(better UX, UI)
### 3- make it more responsive using JS.
### 4-optimize it further more, for better loading speed.
### 5-html storage and light/ dark mode.


all of that would be done just after the exams, now I am building a block to code on it easy.
